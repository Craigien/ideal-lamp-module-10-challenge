Module 10 Challenge

## Description

This web application allows the user to generate a logo image as an SVG file.  It takes user input for various parameters and creates and SVG files using those parameters.  The SVG file can then be viewed in a browser.  The user can also run tests using Jest to test functionality.

## Installation

This application will require Node.js to use.  It will also require running "npm install" to pull in the inquirer and Jest libraries into your environment.

## Usage

To start the application, run the command "node index.js" in your terminal.  You will then be prompted for several inputs needed to generate your SVG file.  Complete all inputs and your SVG file will be generated in the examples folder.

To run the function tests, run the command "npm run test".  This will test the creation of three different SVG text outputs using the three different shapes.
